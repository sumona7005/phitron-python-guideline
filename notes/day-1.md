- What is Python and it's features
    - Python is an **interpreted**, **object-oriented**, **high-level performing** language with **dynamic typed feature**.
    - High-Level: Closer to human language.
- Application of Python
    - Web Application
    - Mobile Applications
    - Desktop Applications
    - Games and 3D Applications
    - Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
    - Data Science
    - Data Analysis
    - Web Scraping
    - Computer Vision
- Why we need to learn Python
    - Beginner friendly
    - Job as Data Scientist
    - Job as Machine Learning Engineer
    - Scripting and Automation
    - Web Development
    - Diversity
    - Write less, do more
- To Do
    - Watch tutorial
    - Take notes
    - Practice problems
    - Seek help

### Environment Setup

- Python setup guide
    - Download Python
    - Check "Add python.exe to PATH
    - Click on "Install Now"
    - Check if installation was successful:
        - Windows search → cmd → python --version 
        - Python version will be displayed
    - Check if Python is working:
        - Windows search → cmd → python
        - A nice environment will be displayed
        - 5+4 → 9 will be displayed
    - Windows search → Python → Open Python → A dedicated Command Promt will open
    - Code editor for Python
        - Visual Studio Code (install)
        - Extenstion: Python (install)

### Write Python Code

- [coding file of first code](/coding-files/1-first.py)
    - Create folder, open with VS Code, create a file named first.py
    - Write `print("Hello World!)
    - Click on triangle button to the right (Run Python File)
        - `print` is a function
        - String should be inside of double quotation `" "`

### Introduction to Variables (theory)

- What is variable
    - Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.
    - variable is treated as a name or identifier that indicates the memory location where it stores the value.
    - `moneybag = 2000` = `variable_name operator value`
    - Types of variable:
        - String (character) `"string"` / `'string'`
        - Number (number) `2000`
        - List (character /+ number) `["list", 500]`
- Variable naming convention
    - Start with character / underscore `a = 10` , `_ = 10`
    - Can't start with number `1a = 10`
    - Can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores 
        - `name = 'jack'` , `num2 = 12` , `my_name = 'jack`
    - Variable names are case-sensitive
        - `age` , `Age` , `AGE` are 3 different variables
    - do not use reserved keywords of Pyrhon

### Variables (coding)

- [coding file of variables](/coding-files/1-variable.py)

### User Input

- [coding file of user input](/coding-files/1-user-input.py)
- Code explained
    - Write `input` and keep it in a variable
        - `user_name = input("Enter your name : ")`
        - `age = input("Enter your age : ")`
    - `print("Hello ", user_name, "Your age is : ", age)`
    - run code and give input on terminal
- `input` returns data in string format

# Notes

### What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level (closer to human language ) performing language with dynamic typed features.

### Applications of Python:
web app, mobile app, desktop app, games and 3D apps, machine learning and artificial intelligence, data science and data analysis, web scraping, computer vision.

### Why should we learn Python?
It's beginner friendly, diverse, writes less and does more.

### Environment setup:
Install Python, Visual studio Code, Python extension in VS Code.

### Check if everything is working:
- windows search → cmd → python --version
- windows search → cmd → python
- windows search → cmd → 3+4
- windows search → python → open python → a dedicated command prompt will open

### How to write first code in Python:
create folder, open with vs code, create file named first.py and write codes (screenshot is attached below)

### What is print?
The print function simply prints the output.
- print syntax: `print(message/variable_name)`

### What is variable?
Variables are the containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters. Variable is treated as a name or identifier that indicates the memory location where it stores the values.
- variable syntax: `variable_name = value`

### What are the types of variable?
- String (character)
- Number (number)
- List (character +/ number)

### Variable naming convention:
- Start with character/underscore
- Can only contain alpha-numeric characters and numbers
- It's case-sensitive (`age`, `Age`, `AGE` are 3 different variables)
- Don't use the reserved keywords of Python

### What is input?
Input in Python is used to take inputs from the users.
- input syntax: `input(message/variable_name)`
- Input returns the data in the string format.
